    "# SNN that detects High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs) with constant parameters\n",
    "This notebook is a simple example of how to use a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) to detect HFOs\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an HFO?\n",
    "High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs) are a type of brain activity that occurs in the range of 80-500 Hz. They are believed to be related to the generation of seizures in patients with epilepsy. The detection of HFOs is an important task in the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy. \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of electrophysiology, HFOs are characterized by their high frequency and short duration, often lasting only a few milliseconds. The wave of a typical HFO consists of at least 4 UP and DOWN waves."
